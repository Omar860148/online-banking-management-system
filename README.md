# online-banking-management-system
This  Banking System web-based was developed by omar mohamed using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavasScript (Ajax and jQuery), Bootstrap, and some other plugins/libraries. On the Admin Side, the system admin user can manage all the records of the clients' accounts and the admin can also make the transaction for the walk-in clients. The admin is also in charge of managing the announcements which will be posted on the public website where all their clients or possible clients can read the post. Then, on the Client Side, as I have mentioned above, the client can make their transaction using the system and also track all their transactions. The system has many minor features which are relevant for this kind of system such as some Error trapping to prevent system errors due to human errors. The clients' credentials can be only created by the admin user.
